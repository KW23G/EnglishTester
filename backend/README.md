# Backend

***There are two things the backend has to do:***

* check if the translation of a word is correct

* get a random word from the json files

*Checking a translation:*

That's pretty easy: As an input we get the english and the german word, then we look
for the english word in data/en_to_de.json and we check if its translation = german word

*Getting random word:*

This is a lot more difficult.
