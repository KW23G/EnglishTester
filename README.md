This is a program that checks if you know english words.

It prints out the german word and you have to type the translation.

When everything is done, you can type 'testme' in the terminal to practise your english.

#########

How we do it:

1: we get a  file with most/all of the english words. (en_words.txt from https://gist.github.com/deekayen/4148741)

2: we write a Python script that translates the words and creates a json file with the words (script.py)

3: we create the real program that checks you (in C)
